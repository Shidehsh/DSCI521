    "Key word in context (KWiC) is a common format for concordance lines, i.e., contextualized instances of principal words used in a book. More generally, KWiC is essentially the concept behind the utility of 'find in page' on document viewers and web browsers. This module builds up a KWiC utility for finding key word-containing sentences, and 'most relevant' paragraphs, quickly.\n",

    "__B6.__ _(5 pts)_ Your goal here is to modify the pre-processing in `load_book` one more time! Make a small modification to the input: `load_book(book_id, pos = True, lemma = True):`, to accept two boolean arguments, `pos` and `lemma` specifying how to identify each word as a key term. In particular, each word will now be represented in both of the `document` and `index` as a tuple: `heading = (text, tag)`, where `text` contains the `word.text` attribute from `spacy` if `lemma = False`, and `word.lemma_` attribute if `True`. Similarly, `tag` should be left empty as `\"\"` if `pos = False` and otherwise contain `word.pos_`. When you've completed this part, exhibit your function's utility by using its ouput in the `fast_kwic` function to search for the key terms `('cold', NOUN)` and `('cold', ADJ)`.\n",
