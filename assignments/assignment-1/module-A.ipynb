This data is obtained from the Census Bureauâ€™s American Community Survey (ACS). The data is stored in a `csv` file format located in the attached `data` directory. Read the `data/demographics.csv` file into a `pandas` dataframe and print the dimensionality (using `.shape` method) and the name of the features of the dataframe. (3 points)"
