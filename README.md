# DSCI 521: Data analysis and interpretation
## College of Computing and Informatics <br> Drexel University
### Welcome to DSCI 521!
This is a first course in graduate level data science at Drexel University focused on analytic phases of work in the data science lifecycle. 

## Course Description
Introduces methods for data analysis and their quantitative foundations in application to pre-processed data. Covers reproducibility and interpretation for project life cycle activities, including data exploration, hypothesis generation and testing, pattern recognition, and task automation. Provides experience with analysis methods for data science from a variety of quantitative disciplines. Concludes with an open-ended term project focused on the application of data exploration and analysis methods with interpretation via statistical, algorithmic, and mathematical reasoning.
- Credits: 3
- Restrictions: None
- Prerequisites: None

## Course Purpose within a Program of Study
This course provides an application-oriented introduction to quantitative reasoning for data science. Hands-on experience is provided with a number analytic techniques and evaluation methods in the context of their quantitative foundations. Via implementation, an understanding for method function, applicability, setup, and interpretation is provided under mathematical frameworks.

This course is a core course in the Data Science Masters program.

## Statement of Expected Learning
The course objectives are to:
- observe and explore a variety of quantitative methods for data analysis;
- understand methods’ evaluation techniques to interpret their output;
- implement and evaluating methods to gain technical experience with data; and
- reproducibly execute an analytic project and represent/communicate its results faithfully.
 

As learning outcomes, students completing this course should be able to take data and a task and identify methods for analysis, reproducibly implement them by using widely-available tools, reason quantitatively to interpret their results, and conduct evaluations for the faithful communication of output.

Specific text information is as follows:
- Data Science from Scratch (DSFS). ISBN: 978-1491901427, O’Riley, April 2015
- Python Data Science Handbook (PDSH). ISBN: 978-1491912058, O’Riley, November 2016
- The Data Science Handbook (TDSH). ISBN:9781119092940, John Wiley & Sons, 2017

### Required and Supplemental Materials and Technologies
Note: instructions and discussion of the following materials and technologies are provided in Chapter 0 of the course lecture notes. Students are expected to have the following by the start of the first week:
- A Github account: https://www.github.com
- A command line environment with Python (version 3) installed
- The Jupyter notebooks interactive development environment

### Lecture Notes
The primary course materials consist of a collection of interactive Jupyter notebooks, which may be found on the course blackboard website and on the following private Github repository:

- http://github.com/jakerylandwilliams/DSCI521/

For access to the Github repository, all students are required to sign up for an account and post user names on the course discussion board. An invite to the Github repository will follow.

The course lecture notes are broken down into the following topics, which roughly correspond to a week of content each. More information on course scheduling can be found in that section, below.

- Chapter 0: System configuration, programming, and numeracy Chapter 1: Processing numeric data
- Chapter 2: Feature engineering and language processing
- Chapter 3: Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Chapter 4: Networks, metrics, and applications
- Chapter 5: Data transformation and analysis of functions
- Chapter 6: Counting and probability for quantitative frameworks
- Chapter 7: Approaching regression and classification problems
- Chapter 8: Model pipelines and comparisons
- Chapter 9: Introduction to neural networks

### Assignments, Assessments, and Evaluations

#### Homework:
Structured, individual assignments will be distributed according to four topic areas:

1. Text analysis and feature engineering
2. Network and exploratory data analysis, including visualization
3. Probabilistic modeling and prediction
4. Machine learning and regression

These assignments will be composed in a modular fashion, with each module/problem worth about 35–45 points apiece. The total assignment value requirement for the term is 400 target points and there will be about 550 possible points available across all modules. Each module can be completed and submitted separately. This means there will be roughly 12–16 modules, total.

#### Project:
One open-ended group assignment will have two phases:

1. Data Set Identification, Motivational Exploration, and Proposed Methods Implementation
2. Methods Implementation, Evaluation, and Interpretation, with Documentation and Dissemination

### Course Schedule
The course’s schedule follows the lecture notes at roughly one week per chapter with the expectation that students will configure systems and review or work through the numeracy and processing fundamentals in __Chapter 0__. Some chapters may extend over multiple weeks, depending on the section’s pace. __Week 10__ and the regularly scheduled __final exam__ period (the same day of week and time of the regularly scheduled class meetings, but during exam week) are reserved for final project presentations.
